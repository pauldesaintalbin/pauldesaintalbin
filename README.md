ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul de Saint-Albin, 14 years old, and I live in France<br>
ðŸ‘€ I'm Interested in web development since I was 12. I'm also learning cyber-security<br>
I coded these websites (only in French):
- <a href="https://ptdr.alwaysdata.net">A platform to share jokes</a>
- <a href="https://twitterstatsjaaj.herokuapp.com">A page to see the most vulgar Twitter users</a> - I coded a bot in Python with Tweepy and the Twitter API to search vulgar tweets and put them into a database
